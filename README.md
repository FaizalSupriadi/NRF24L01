I made a simple library for the nrf24l01+ chip, with some more limited use. You are not able to use it to
transmit and receive data from multiple devices.
This library is created as a project for the Hogeschool Utrecht, HBO-ICT.

It is best used for simple projects that do not require extremely fast speed.
